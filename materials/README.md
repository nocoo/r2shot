# R2Shot submission materials

Everything needed to produce R2Shot's submission package lives in this repository. No sibling project, joint delivery directory, brand-site checkout, or image-generation API is needed to reproduce the approved artwork.

- [2.0.0 gallery](2.0.0/index.html)
- [2.0.0 interactive preview](2.0.0/preview.html)
- [2.0.0 standalone English website](2.0.0/site/index.html)
- [Manual testing guide](2.0.0/TESTING.md)
- [Earlier designs and the approved family HTML](../docs/design/README.md)

## Generate from this repository

Requires Bun, Node.js, Python 3, Bash/zip and Chrome. Puppeteer is a development dependency only. Install the repository dependencies with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, then run:

```sh
bun run materials
```

This runs unit tests with the existing coverage gates, lint, repository E2E/workflow tests, and a production build; extracts the ZIP and tests it in Chrome; writes the English copy; builds the interactive UI preview; renders the 9 store images; creates the standalone website and gallery; and checks the HTML and assets in Chrome. It never commits, pushes, publishes, or submits to a store.

On macOS it uses the installed Google Chrome. Elsewhere, set `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to your Chrome executable, or use Puppeteer's installed browser. To recheck materials without rebuilding:

```sh
bun run materials:check
```

ZIPs are checked in for direct download. `unpacked/` is reproducible and excluded from Git. If a new build has identical file contents, the existing ZIP is retained so its approved checksum stays stable.

## Updating a later version

Keep the manifest and `package.json` versions synchronized. Edit `source/copy.json` (including its version), `artwork.json` and `site.json` for the new release. The Chrome check refreshes the UI images and `captures/provenance.json`. When starting a new release, update the capture version together with the campaign inputs; those images must depict the tested version and use synthetic configuration. The generator refuses a different copy/capture version so it cannot silently relabel an old campaign as a new release. Preserve the dated references in `docs/design/`.

Original decorative images and prompts are retained; only a new art direction needs the Azure image-generation skill. Original logos are never regenerated or recolored. Fonts retain their included SIL Open Font License notices.

`verification/build.json` binds the current tests to the package checksum and runtime-file hashes. `approved-family-*` files preserve the original joint review and are historical records. HTML preview requests are simulated. Real webhook endpoints, Chrome clipboard behavior, and a live R2 bucket/CDN are covered by manual acceptance with the installed extension. The gallery marks manual acceptance as pending until it is recorded.

Store requirements: screenshots 1280×800 (3 ordered uploads); small promos 440×280 (3 alternatives for one slot); optional marquees 1400×560 (3 alternatives for one slot). All supplied images are opaque RGB PNGs. Use variant 01 for a general-purpose promo.
